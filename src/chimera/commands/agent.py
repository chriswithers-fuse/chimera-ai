    registry name alone, which the address grammar change would have stranded: it looked
    for ``@@captain``, a name no session had ever carried, while the row itself was right
    there under the address the migration had just given it.

    Session identity lives in the archive, and is asked for **by address**, never by the
    axes that happen to match it: a raw ``claude`` or an errand's one-shot run in the same
    worktree records those axes too, and reviving a human's private conversation under the
    agent's name is precisely what an address is for preventing. The address maps
    to its newest session — live or dead, resuming is how a dead one is revived — and
    that session's immutable native id is the resume target; the registry name is
    display-only (a rename in the harness's UI must not orphan the session).

    There is no by-name fallback, and there deliberately isn't one to guard: an address
    that resolves to nothing — no workspace to hold an archive, an address it has never
    seen, or nothing left whose transcript still exists — is **refused**, naming the
    cause and the fresh start. ``claude --resume <name>`` was that fallback, and a name
    claude couldn't match dropped a *headless* resume into its interactive session
    picker, where it blocked indefinitely with no start hook ever firing — a launch that
    ``ch ls`` showed alive and that nothing would ever finish. Post-rewrite every session
    chimera launches in a workspace is archived, so the name has no legitimate job left
    in a resume; a session chimera never recorded is one it never addressed, and the
    harness's own tools are the way back into that.

    Sessions whose transcript the harness has pruned are skipped in favour of an older
    one that still has its file: handing claude an id it no longer knows produced a raw
    "No conversation found" traceback, which is the failure this whole design started
