    technical address (``@@captain`` — its persona is a separate, cosmetic identity,
    never the session name), and it works on the workspace as a whole (no goal, branch
    or worktree).

    A goal never chats: it already has its agent, and a second session on the same
    branch/worktree invites launch-order traps and lifecycle interference — so a pinned
    goal refuses, pointing at both real options. ``goal`` carries an explicitly
    requested goal that scope resolution couldn't pin (a ``-g`` with no project): asked
