"""The harnesses Chimera launches agent sessions in.

Each harness subclasses :class:`Agent` and registers in ``chimera.agents.registry``
(claude today; codex and friends to come). The split is facts vs policy: an adapter
*declares* facts — its platform name, its restricted flag spellings, what its own
registry claims is live — while the shared layer applies policy: restriction when an
AI agent is driving (``chimera.commands.agent.refuse_restricted``) and distrust of
registry claims (:meth:`Agent.live`).

    server-backed harness may have no pid to claim); ``summary`` is listing enrichment.
    ``create_time`` is the pid's other half (see :func:`~chimera.processes.
    process_create_time`): filled in by :meth:`Agent.checked`, and — when a caller
    supplies one it captured earlier — the thing that catches a reused pid.
    ``stale`` is ``None`` while there is no reason to doubt the session is live;
