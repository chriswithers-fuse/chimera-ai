"""Tab-completion callbacks for value-taking parameters.

Completion runs in-process on every TAB (Click calls back with ``_CH_COMPLETE`` set),
so these reuse the listers and scope like them: narrowed by flags/cwd, widened to the
workspace otherwise. A completer must never raise or print — a failure (no workspace,
ghost project, half-typed junk) silently completes to nothing.

Group callbacks are not invoked while completing (Click only resilient-parses the
line), so a ``-p`` typed at any level is read from the raw context chain rather than
the usual ``Overrides`` on ``ctx.obj``.
