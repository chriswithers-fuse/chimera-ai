"""The archive: the central, cross-referencing store of LLM sessions and what they did.

Logging (loguru JSONL) records *what happened*, line by line. The archive is the
index *over* those happenings — the one place that ties them together: which chat
ran where, on which harness, for which goal, which actors worked it, and when. It is
a single SQLite database in WAL mode, so any number of ``ch`` processes (agents and
humans alike) can read and write it at once: many concurrent readers, writers
serialised for milliseconds by SQLite itself. The session hooks (``ch hook``) feed
it; it is the component other commands and hooks call.

It archives *every* LLM session on the machine, not just Chimera's, keyed by
**``platform``** — the harness that ran the model and owns the native session id
(``claude``/``codex``/``aider``), so session identity is ``(platform, native_id)``,
matching :class:`chimera.agents.AgentSession`.

What it holds is deliberately narrow: **identity, location, address and lifecycle**.
Searchable history, cost and summaries are not its job — agentsview does those better,
and conflating them is what let this store's answers to "who is this session, is it
really live, how do I resume it" go quietly wrong. Chimera's own axes
(``workspace``/``project``/``goal``/``actor``) are null for a session that ran outside a
managed worktree. Two record types:

- :class:`ArchiveSession` — one run, denormalised with the axes above so a cross-reference
  is a ``WHERE``, not a join.
- :class:`Event` — one timestamped thing that happened, optionally tied to a session;
  the append-only timeline that stitches the logs to the sessions that produced them.
  Sessions are upserted to current state; events accumulate forever.

Timestamps must be timezone-aware; they are stored as ISO 8601 text and ordered
lexicographically, so keep them in a single zone (UTC) for a correct timeline.

      resume. Only evidence writes it — a chimera launch, or inheritance across a bridge.

    ``addressable`` is the harness's verdict on whether this is a conversation at all: a
    ``claude agents`` browser draft and a one-shot ``claude -p`` both fire real session
    hooks but must never hold an address. Distinct from *having* one — a hand-launched

    the surviving columns and is renamed into place.

    **Two pragmas guard the rename, and both are load-bearing.** ``ALTER TABLE … RENAME``
    rewrites referencing keys to follow the rename, so ``events`` comes to point at
    ``sessions_legacy``. That single mechanism breaks the history twice over, and each
    half needs its own pragma:

    - ``foreign_keys=OFF`` stops the ``DROP`` cascade-deleting every event. Caught against
      a real 247-session archive, which lost all 262 of its events.
    - ``legacy_alter_table=ON`` stops the rewrite happening at all, so ``events`` keeps
      pointing at ``sessions`` — the table ``SCHEMA`` recreates. Without it the rebuild
      succeeds, the events survive the drop, and the archive is left referencing a table
      that no longer exists: every later ``INSERT INTO events`` fails with ``no such
      table: main.sessions_legacy``, so hooks, heartbeats and reconciliation all die the
      moment the migration is declared a success.

    The second was missed because reasoning stopped at the cascade, and because every test
    here read after migrating and none wrote. The events are the append-only history this
    whole design exists to keep; a migration must leave them writable, not merely present.

    The dying ``manager`` column earns its keep on the way out. It recorded whether a
    *launcher* stamped the session, which is exactly the evidence the new ``address``
    demands — so a manager/captain claim survives only where ``manager='chimera'`` or the
    axes name a goal worktree (where the address follows the actor, not a guess). Every
    other historical claim was inferred from geography alone, and geography never
