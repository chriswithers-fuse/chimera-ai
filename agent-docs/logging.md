# Logging

One JSONL sink: `<workspace>/state/log.jsonl` (gitignored), written by loguru through a
custom one-line-JSON format (see `chimera/logging.py`). Every CLI action lands a start/end
pair through `LoggingCommand` → `log_start`/`log_finish`.

Every line carries `caller` — the address of whoever ran the command (the captain's
persona, `<project>@manager`, `<project>@<goal>@agent`; `chimera.context.caller`), bound as
loguru's default extra by `configure()` so no call site has to know. Deliberately not named
`session`: lines about a session the command *acts on* bind that key (`agent stop`, the
stale-session warnings), and the actor must never be displaced by the acted-upon.
Best-effort: a workspace too broken to resolve it (doctor's territory) logs unattributed
rather than not at all. An action given a goal (`goal start`/`finish`, `worktree add`, an explicit `-g`)
likewise carries `goal` on every line of its run — `LoggingCommand` contextualizes it over
the whole invoke, so the frames and everything logged between them grep by goal.

## Observability: the log alone must be enough to debug a run

The start/end frame proves a command ran; it says nothing about what it *did*. Between the
pair, log what the command examined, decided and changed — someone holding only the log must
be able to reconstruct the run and undo its mutations. Two forces, in tension:

- **Log decisions and outcomes, not motion.** A line earns its place by answering "what did
  the command see / decide / change": a step's conclusion, a mutation (see ref safety below),
  a fallback taken, a fix refused. Never log loop iterations, function entry/exit, or a
  restatement of what the frame already carries (params, duration) — spew buries the signal
  it pretends to add.
- **Levels are triage, not decoration.** DEBUG = the git command trace (below) — never triage
  material; INFO = normal operation (a step ran and concluded, a deliberate mutation); WARNING =
  degraded but continuing (a fallback taken); ERROR = needs attention (a problem found and left
  unresolved, an action that failed).

**Uniform steps log at their driver.** When a family of steps shares a loop (doctor's checks),
the loop logs for all of them so a new step can't forget to. `ch doctor` is the model: every
check lands `<name>: checked` with its findings count bound, and every finding lands its own
line (`fixable`/`resolved` bound) — ERROR while unresolved, INFO once fixed.

## Viewing the log

`ch logtail` is the human view — human-only, in fact: it's in `RESTRICTED_COMMANDS`, stripped
from every AI session's tree (captain included), since a blocking follow is a dead end for an
agent, which reads the JSONL directly. It pipes `tail -F` through `fblog` (a doctor check
verifies it's installed; `--fix` brew-installs it) with a main-line format tuned to the fields
above — a fixed-width `caller` column (who ran it), then `command`, `goal`, `phase`,
`duration_ms`, `error` — since the frame lines carry an empty `message`
that a generic JSON viewer would render blank. `-n N` sets the initial line count,
`--no-follow` takes one look and exits, and `-d/--dump` is the post-mortem surface: every
field of every record (params, git before/after maps, full tracebacks).

## Git command trace

Every git subprocess runs through `chimera.git.Git` (never `giterator.Git` directly), whose two
entry points — `__call__` for text output, `raw` for bytes (diff text and `-z` names, which git
never transcodes; it also keeps stderr out of what callers parse) — each land a DEBUG line
*before* the command runs, so a hung fetch is on record while it
hangs (`tail -f state/log.jsonl` to watch live — the raw form deliberately, since agents
don't get `ch logtail`). The message is the exact command
(`git fetch --prune origin`), the working directory rides `git_cwd`. The trace goes only to the
log file, never the console (and is suppressed during shell completion, where the file sink
isn't configured). `chimera.git` also injects network timeouts (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`
connect/keepalive, `GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_*`) unless the user set their own, so a dead transport
fails in seconds instead of hanging forever. The trace is spew-exempt by construction: it lives
at DEBUG, below the triage levels, and tests pin their captures to INFO+ so command sequences
are never asserted.

## Conventions

- Bind structured data with `logger.bind(key=value)` — never f-string it into the message.
  Bound keys serialise as fields on the JSON line (like `params`).
- The message is the canonical command path (`'worktree rm'`), not a sentence.
- Exception: `ch logtail`'s main line renders only the message, so a line whose point *is*
  the live tail also carries its key facts in the text — the mail lines are the model
  (`comms: send <sender> -> <to> [<kind>] <subject> (<id>)`, one `log_action` helper in
  `chimera.comms` so no site drifts) — with the same data still bound structured. Keep the
  text bounded: elide anything long (comms elides subjects past 60 chars, and bodies never
  enter the text at all) — the bound field carries the whole value.

## Ref safety (mandatory)

Any time you **add, repoint, or delete** a git ref (branch, tag, any named ref), record the
affected refs and the **full** sha each points at — both before and after the change — so the
log alone is enough to restore a ref (`git branch <name> <sha>`). Pioneered by `goal adopt`;
standard for every site that touches a ref.

**`Git.ref_log` is the canonical mechanism** — wrap the mutating block, never hand-roll the
snapshots:

<!-- invisible-code-block: python
from testfixtures import TempDir
from giterator.testing import Repo

from chimera.git import Git

d = TempDir().create()
git = Git(Repo.make(d / 'repo').path)
refs = ('main',)
goal = 'g'
-->

```python
with git.ref_log('worktree rm: refs', *refs, goal=goal):
    ...  # the mutations
```

<!-- invisible-code-block: python
d.cleanup()
-->

It snapshots the named refs either side of the block and lands one line, skipped when nothing
changed; `always=True` for a site whose line is the recovery record even on a no-op re-run
(`goal adopt`); the yielded handle's `.bind(...)` adds keys only known mid-block. The `after`
snapshot runs in a `finally`, so a block that dies half-way still records what it completed.

Shape — **one line per action**, a `git` key holding `before`/`after` maps of `{ref: full-sha}`
(existing refs only; a ref absent from a map didn't exist at that point). The message is the
command path with a `: refs` suffix, so it reads apart from the `LoggingCommand` action line.

The before→after pair encodes which operation happened:

| Operation | `before`            | `after`             |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| create    | `{}`                | `{ref: sha}`        |
| delete    | `{ref: sha}`        | `{}`                |
| repoint   | `{ref: old-sha}`    | `{ref: new-sha}`    |

Full shas only — `ref_log` captures them via `Git.ref_shas` (existing refs → full sha); short
shas aren't safe to recover from. A site that genuinely can't use the context manager still
follows the same rules: `before` taken *ahead of* the first mutating call (the refs may be gone
afterwards), `after` once done, line skipped when nothing changed.

**Moving HEAD (a checkout)** — switching a worktree onto a different branch is not a ref-value
mutation (neither branch's sha changes), so the skip-when-unchanged rule above doesn't apply: log
it anyway, because the recovery datum is *where HEAD pointed*, not a repointed ref. Use the same
shape but key each side by the **branch HEAD was on**, mapped to that HEAD's full sha — `before`
the branch left behind, `after` the branch switched to (`'HEAD'` as the key when detached). To undo,
`git -C <worktree> checkout <before-key>`. Pioneered by doctor's `worktree-branch` check.
